      <p>Every morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light. This is Pride Rock, home to Mufasa and his lovely wife, Queen Sarabi. On a particular morning, animals from all the Pride Lands had journeyed to Pride Rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub, Simba.</p>

      <p>As part of the celebration, Rafiki had a special duty. He cranked open a gourd, dipped his finger inside, and made a mark on Simba's forehead. Then he lifted the future King up high for all to see. The elephants trumpeted with their trunks, the monkeys jumped up and down, and the zebras stamped with their hooves with happiness.</p>

      <p>Not far from the ceremony, in a cave at the backside of Pride Rock, a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled. Life's not fair. This was Mufasa's brother, Scar, who was jealous of Simba's position as the next King. Moments later, Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave. Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba. Zazu, Mufasa's trusted advisor, also appeared. You should have been first in line. I was first in line until the little hairball was born. And with that, Scar stalked out of the cave.</p>

      <p>Before long, Simba grew into a healthy, playful young cub. Early one morning, he and Mufasa climbed to the top of Pride Rock. As they looked out at the rising sun, Mufasa pointed to the light beams that stretched across the Pride Lands. Look Simba: Everything the light touches is our kingdom. Simba scanned the horizon and noticed a dark spot in the distance. What about that shadowing place ? That's beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba. But I thought a king can do what ever he wants.</p></div></div>  </div>

      <p>Later, as Simba headed back to down the path, he ran into Scar. Hey uncle Scar! Guess what? I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock. My dad just showed me the whole kingdom! And I'm gonna rule it all! Scar looked slyly the young cub. He didn't showed you what's beyond that rise at the northern border. Well no. He said I can't go there. And he's absolutely right. It's far to dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. Promise me you never visit that dread- full place.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>When Simba returned home, he found his friend Nala and her mother, Sarafina, visiting with Sarabi. Come on! I just heard about this great place! The mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go, as long as Zazu went with them. Simba and Nala raced across the Pride Lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird. They led him trough many herds of animals until they finally lost him.</p></div></div>  </div>

      <p>One the cubs were free of Zazu, Simba pounced on Nala, then Nala flipped Simba onto his back. They tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine litter with elephant skulls and bones. Simba looked around and gasped. This is it! We made it! Before the cubs could explore any farther, Zazu tracked them down. We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands. And right now we're all in very real danger.</p>
      </div></div>  </div>

      <p>Suddenly three hyenas slithered out the eye sockets of an elephant skull. Frightened, Simba, Nala and Zazu jumped back. It was Banzai, his partner, Shenzi, and the always - laughing Ed. Banzai sneered. A trio of trespassers. Zazu tried to lead the cubs to safety, but Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down. The hyenas circled their prey, licking their chops. What's the hurry? We're love you to stick around for dinner.</p>

      <p>While the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom, Simba, Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away.They gave chase, and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could. Finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones. Just when it looked as if it were all over for the cubs, Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw. If you ever come to my son again.The hyenas slicked away, and Mufasa glared at Simba. You deliberately disobeyed me! I'm very disappointed in you !</p></div></div>  </div>

      <p>Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son. I was just trying to be brave, like you. Being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble. Dad we're pals right? And we'll always be together right? Mufasa looked up at the stars. Simba, let me tell you something my father told me: Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be their to guide you. And so will I.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>Meanwhile, the hyenas received another visitor: An angry Scars showed up at the lair. I practically gift wrapped those cubs and you couldn't even dispose of them. Scar warned the hyenas to be prepared. Banzai laughed. Yeah! Be prepared!.. For what? Scar looked at him with danger in his eyes. For the death of the king. </p></div></div>  </div>

      <p>The following day, Scar invited Simba to join in the gorge. When they arrived, Scar turned to his young nephew. Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprice for you. Moments after he left, Scar signaled the hyenas, who chased a herd of wildebeest directly toward Simba. From a distance, Mufasa noticed the rising dust. Scar appeared quickly at his side. Stampede! In the gorge! Simba's down there! Without waiting a second, Mufasa took of to save his young son.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>Mufasa plunged into the gorge and battled his way through the oncoming wildebeests. Suddenly Mufasa was knocked back into the stampede. Desperately he tried to climb up another ledge from which Scar stood looking down on him. Brother - help me! Scar reached for Mufasa and pulled him close enough to whisper in his ear. Then Scar let go of Mufasa and he fell to his death. Simba peered over the ridge just as his father disappeared beneath the thundering stampede.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>Later, Scar found Simba hovering over his father's body, sobbing. It was an accident. I didn't mean for it to happen. But the king is dead. And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive. Oh, what will your mother think? Simba sobbed harder. What am I gong to do? Run away, Simba. Run! Run away and never return. Simba did as he was told, unaware that his uncle's hyenas friends had been ordered to finish him of. Scar returned to Pride Rock to take over the throne. </p></div></div> </div>

      <p>Meanwhile, Simba plodded across the Savannah without any food or water. It wasn't long he fainted under the hot sun. As the vultures circled overhead, a big-hearted warthog named Bumbaa stumbled upon the young lion. He turned to his trusty pal, a fast-talking meerkat named Timon. He's so cute and all alone. Can we keep him? Pumbaa, are you nuts? Lions eat guys like us. But Pumbaa scooped Simba up anyway, and carried him to safety.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>When Simba awoke,the first thought that sprang to mind was his father's death. Timon taught about HAKUNA MATATA,which means no responsibilities,no worries.He stayed in the jungle with Pumbaa and Timon a long,long time,and grew into a very big lion. One night he looked up at the stars and recalled the words his father had told him long ago.The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. And so will I.</p></div></div> </div>

      <p>The next day, Pumbaa was stalked and chased by a lioness. Simba came to his rescue, but after wrestling with the lioness, who easily flipped him onto his back, he realized that she was his old friend. Nala? What are you doing here? Why didn't you return to Pride Rock? You're the king! I'm not the king. Scar is Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands. What? There's no food, no water. If you don't do something, soon, everyone will starve. You're our only hope. I can't go back.</p></div></div> </div>

But Rafiki knew the time had come for Simba to take his place in the Circle of Life. Who are you? The question is: Who are you? I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure. Well, I know who you are.

How can I prove myself to you? Run. Run away and never return. Scar started to slink off, but then he turned and lunged one last time at Simba.
